Server: would store the code that detemines the most efficient way
to request any of that data from the database

Authentication: determines that the user at that is trying to access the server or
the database is who they say they are

Firebase is generally a solution or a platform that has all of this
handled for us so we didn't actually have to write any back end code at all
